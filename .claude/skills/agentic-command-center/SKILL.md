# /agentic-command-center

A guided blueprint for building an **AI command center** for a business: a single place where you (or your team) type or speak a request — *"how did sales do this week?"*, *"turn on the shop lights"*, *"draft a reply to that customer"* — and one AI figures out which of your systems to touch and does it.

This skill does **not** hand you a finished product, and it does **not** build one for you. It walks you, phase by phase, through the *thinking* and the *order of operations* so you can go and build your own version on whatever stack you like. Go one phase at a time. Don't skip ahead — each phase depends on the one before it.

## How to use this skill

When invoked, act as an **advisor and architect**. Ask the user about their business, then take them through the four phases below, generally in order. At each phase: explain the goal in plain language, help them make the decisions for *their* business, and check in before moving on.

### Operating guidance

This skill is primarily **guidance-focused**: it helps produce understanding, decisions, and direction rather than a finished implementation.

**Default to:**
- Explaining concepts, principles, trade-offs, and a sensible *order* of work.
- Asking questions about the user's business and helping them reason about *their* answers.
- Helping them decide **what** to build and **why** it comes in that order, before diving into **how**.

If partway through the user asks for actual code, a scaffold, or an implementation, that's a normal and legitimate request — treat it as the user changing the task, not as something to resist. Say where that fits relative to the four phases below, then help with it as you normally would. This skill's job is to make sure the planning happened; it isn't a lock on the rest of the conversation.

If it's useful, the reference system mentioned in Phase 1 (ForgeChat, linked below) is one example of a working system in this space — worth a look if the user wants something concrete to study, not a requirement.

Treat the four phases below as a **destination to describe, not a task to perform.**

## Phase 1 — Map your business into systems you own

Before any AI, you need **the data**. An AI command center is only as good as the systems it can see.

1. **List the core functions of the business.** Sales/CRM, finance, operations, content/marketing, support, HR, inventory — whatever actually runs the company. Keep it to the handful that matter.
2. **For each function, you want one simple internal system (a dashboard) that holds your own data on your own server.** The guiding principle here is **data ownership**: the numbers, customers, and conversations that run your business should live somewhere *you* control, not locked inside a SaaS vendor's account. That ownership is what makes everything in the later phases possible.
3. **Start with the function that hurts the most** — usually customer messaging or money. Build (or adopt) that one first. One good system beats five half-built ones.

> ### You don't have to start from scratch
> Building your first internal system is the biggest hurdle. **ForgeChat** (`https://github.com/Forgemind-git/ForgeChat`) is one open-source example of exactly this kind of system — a self-hosted WhatsApp inbox and CRM that keeps customer data on your own server. Study it as a reference, or use something else entirely — the point of Phase 1 is data ownership, not any specific tool.

**Outcome of Phase 1:** at least one internal system, holding your own data, that you fully control.

## Phase 2 — Connect each system to the tools you already use

An internal system that only knows about itself is an island. Make each one reflect what's *actually* happening in the business by wiring it to the outside services you already live in.

1. **For each system, list the external channels it should be aware of** — WhatsApp, Instagram, email, calendars, ad platforms, payment tools, and so on.
2. **Connect them** so activity flows in (and, where it makes sense, out): a customer message on Instagram shows up in the same place as one on WhatsApp; a payment reflects in your finance view; a booking lands on the calendar.
3. **Aim for "one source of truth" per function.** The point is that when you later ask your command center a question, the answer is real and current — not a stale copy.

Keep this channel-by-channel and incremental. Every integration you add makes the eventual command center more useful.

**Outcome of Phase 2:** your systems mirror real business activity, because they're plugged into the tools your business already runs on.

---

## Phase 3 — Expose each system as an MCP server

Now make your systems **speakable to an AI**. The open standard for this is **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — a common way to describe a system as a set of *tools* an AI can call (e.g. "list this week's orders", "get outstanding invoices", "send a reply").

Principles to follow — the details of the stack don't matter, these do:

1. **One MCP per system.** Each internal dashboard gets its own MCP interface. Keep them separate and self-contained.
2. **Read before write.** Start by exposing only **read-only** tools (fetch, list, summarize). Get the AI reliably *seeing* your business before you let it *change* anything.
3. **Gate every write and destructive action.** Anything that sends, edits, deletes, or spends money stays **off by default** and is turned on deliberately, one tool at a time, once you trust it. This single rule prevents almost every "the AI did something I didn't want" disaster.
4. **Name tools the way a human would ask.** Clear, business-language tool names make the AI far better at picking the right one later.

**Outcome of Phase 3:** every system speaks MCP, exposing a safe, mostly read-only set of tools an AI can call.

---

## Phase 4 — Unify everything under one command layer

This is the command center itself: a **single AI agent that sits in front of all your MCPs**. It's the one interface you and your team actually use.

The flow it follows is simple to state:

> **Understand → Route → Act.**
> Understand what the person is asking. Route to the right system (or systems). Act — read the answer, or perform the change — and report back.

Design principles:

1. **One front door.** A single chat (and, if you want, voice) surface for the whole business. The user shouldn't have to know *which* system holds the answer — that's the agent's job to figure out.
2. **Let it span systems.** The best requests cross boundaries — "which customers who paid late this month have an open support ticket?" pulls from finance *and* support. The command layer's value is exactly this stitching-together.
3. **Keep the human in control of writes.** Reads can be automatic; anything that changes the world should be confident and, where it matters, confirmed. Carry the Phase 3 gating principle all the way up.
4. **Grow it by adding systems, not rewriting it.** Because every system is just another MCP behind the same front door, you expand the command center's power simply by building or connecting the next system and plugging it in.

**Outcome of Phase 4:** one place — by chat or voice — to run the entire business.

## The principles, in one breath

- **Own your data.** Everything starts with systems *you* control.
- **Read before write.** See the business reliably before you let AI change it.
- **Gate the dangerous stuff.** Writes and deletes are off until you deliberately turn them on.
- **One system at a time.** Build, connect, and MCP-ify each function on its own.
- **Standard interfaces.** MCP everywhere means the command layer grows by plugging in, never by rewriting.

Follow those in order and you end up with an AI that genuinely runs your business — built on systems you own.
